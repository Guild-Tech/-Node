    "Intel's Core processors have long been known for their balance of affordability and high performance, excelling in everyday tasks with impressive per-core speeds. The 12th Gen Core lineup introduces a hybrid architecture, combining high-performance big cores with power-efficient little cores for improved speed and efficiency, especially with Windows 11's updated thread scheduler. For users requiring more cores, expanded memory, or multi-GPU support, Intelâ€™s Xeon-based systems offer a powerful alternative.",
